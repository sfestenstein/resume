- Participated in HMI development by porting legacy Java code to C++/Qt. Modernized the build process using CMake and updated developer tools to industry standards
  

*Terrestrial Layer System (TLS) Development*
- Consulted and later developer with the UI Team.  Implemented a geographic map application to paint tracks on top of a map that can be panned and zoomed, much like Google Maps.  Updated build process to use CMake.  Updated internal data models to use SQLite databases.  Addressed software defects, stability, and performance.

*Shipboard Panoramic Electro-Optical Infra-Red (SPEIR) - HMI Lead*
- Led a team of 4 engineers to develop front-end software for the SPEIR program, using Qt framework and C++ on RHEL 8 to develop and deploy.  Employed video streaming technology to display multiple videos from various imaging sensors on Naval Surface Vessels.  Developed an OpenGL Video Player to render streaming videos in H264 and H265 format.  Developed middleware using ZeroMQ and Google Protocol Buffers to interact with backend. 

*BLQ-10 OMI Working Group Software Lead*
- Participated in an Operator Machine Interface (OMI) Working group to develop next-generation user interfaces from scratch.  Took responsibility of all aspects of SW Development.  Led a team to implement SW features and updates under demanding timelines.  Employed OpenGL and the Qt framework with C++ to create an attractive and responsive user interface. Prepared SW for customer demonstration and feedback every 6-8 weeks. 

*BLQ-10 Electronic Warfare System*
- Developed front-end software in Java Swing and later in C++ with the Qt Framework.  Employed OpenGL to render large data sets quickly.  Used DDS for inter process communication.  Interfaced with multiple SQL databases.  Engaged in many aspects of Electronic Warfare.
